description         A small replacement for GNU readline() for UNIX

long_description    \
    This is a small line editing library. It can be linked into almost any program to provide command line editing and history functions. It is call \
    compatible with the FSF readline library, but at a fraction of the size, and as a result fewer features. It is also distributed under a much \
    more liberal License.
